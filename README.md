# RevJS - Rev up your data-driven JS app development!

RevJS is a rapid application development toolkit designed to simplify creation
of data-driven JS apps.

The `rev-models` module is the core component of RevJS, which includes a model metadata
registry, field types, CRUD functions and simple in-memory data storage to help new
users get up and running quickly.

This project is currently in pre-alpha stages, but is getting closer to alpha!

The basic idea is, this code:

```typescript
class Person {
    id: number;
    name: string;
    email: string;
}

rev.register(Person, {
    fields: [
        new rev.IntegerField('id', 'Id'),
        new rev.TextField('name', 'Full Name'),
        new rev.EmailField('email', 'Email Address'),
    ]
})
```

...plus a small amount of configuration, gives you:

 * Create, Read, Update, Delete access to Person records from a database

 * A full HTTP REST API (with a swagger specification)

 * Fully-customiseable, automatically generated forms for a variety of UI frameworks

 * Data-validation and other model methods shared between client and server (write once, validate everywhere :) )
