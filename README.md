# RevJS - Rev up your data-driven JS app development!

RevJS is a rapid application development toolkit designed to simplify creation
of isomorphic data-driven JS apps for Mobile and Desktop.

The `rev-models` module is the core component of RevJS, which includes the model
registry, field types, CRUD functions and simple in-memory data storage.

This project is currently in pre-alpha stages, but is getting closer to alpha!

## Features

This toolkit will eventually have the following features:

 * Easy-to-use model definition and CRUD functions
 
 * Isomorphic (client + server) model validation

 * Connectors for many popular databases for data persistence

 * Plugins for popular NodeJS frameworks to expose models as REST APIs as desired

 * Integrations with popular UI frameworks for form rendering + validation

 * 100% test coverage
